        <h1 class="bio">What do neuroscience, rock climbing, building, teaching, and psychology have to do with UX design?</h1>
        
        <h2 class="bio-section-head">Neuroscience</h2>
            <p class="bio-description">I worked in neuroscience research for 5 years and while I loved it, I knew that it wasn’t the career path I wanted to pursue. I had a simultaneous duh and ah-ha moment when I discovered UX design as a career path. This was not only because I realized I am constantly thinking about technology usability, but also because the design process closely resembles the scientific one I have come to love. My most recent project required me to quickly become an expert on a topic I had no knowledge of. I was able to quickly get a feel for the current knowledge surrounding the topic and begin asking questions about what we didn’t know. I developed assays and behavioral paradigms aimed at answering those questions and then organized a large scale project to collect all of the data I needed to characterize our mouse models’ behavior and biochemical changes over the course of their lifetime.  This was a long process that involved multiple experiments, thoughtful questions, and countless redesigns. At the end of the day, what I cherish the most about research is the process, and I find that if you enjoy and take pride in the process, the end result is that much stronger. </p>
            
        <h2 class="bio-section-head">Rock Climbing</h2>
            <p class="bio-description">I discovered rock climbing in San Diego and immediately developed a strong passion for it. It has taught me many invaluable life lessons that help me in being a stronger problem solver. Often times there isn’t an obvious path to your end goal so all you can do is take the next step. That next step isn’t always forward but it had the potential of opening up a whole new world of possibilities. There are times where you can’t figure out what to do and you ask yourself why you’re even bothering. You want to give up but decide that isn’t an option. The only option is to confront the problem head on and try different solutions until you find one that works. I have taken that lesson and applied it to all areas of my life. Giving up isn’t an option. Opening yourself to possibilities, trying different approaches, and finding a solution is one of the most satisfying feelings I can imagine and I strive to work towards that in all areas of my life. </p>
            
        <h2 class="bio-section-head">Building</h2>  
            <p class="bio-descriptions">I started building things when I was a kid. It started with forts, a 3D model of Harry Potter world, an a robot made out of cardboard and progressed to large chicken coops, hydroponic systems, and car builds complete with a bed/sofa, practical/organized storage, and a dining table. Recently, I’ve been designing van conversions. I find the problem of trying to fit everything necessary to live comfortably into a small, moving space to be very intriguing and applying my design skills in order to research and a design a minimum viable product that adheres to some very strict spatial and functional requirements has been invigorating. This constantly iterative process has allowed me to cultivate, refine, and expand my design process into physical as well as digital spaces.</p>
            
        <h2 class="bio-section-head">Teaching</h2> 
            <p class="bio-descriptions">I have had many opportunities to teach and serve as a mentor in the science world, the climbing world and through volunteer work aimed at helping children through horseback riding. My favorite teaching experience was when I had a subset of 20 students for 3 hours a week for an advanced research methods class. I got to see my students through the process of designing a study, collecting data, writing up results and conclusions, and then presenting at a mini conference. I loved sitting alongside a students while they articulated their thought process because it gave me a unique insight into how they solved problems. Teaching a wide range of topics in a wide range of settings has taught me the importance of empathy, meeting someone where they are, gaining a shared understanding, asking appropriate questions, and coming up with a solution that works on many levels.</p>
            
        <h2 class="bio-section-head">Psychology</h2>  
            <p class="bio-descriptions">I went to a Spanish immersion elementary school and thus, the understanding that people see, interpret and communicate in different and unique ways was instilled in me at a young age. The curiosity surrounding the differences in cognition led me to pursue a degree in Psychology, where I studied why people behave in certain ways and how they arrive at certain conclusions.  Understanding humans and their behaviors is vital to a career in UX design and I take every opportunity to ask questions about someone’s motivations. I believe that many products fail because the design moves forward without having a deep understanding of the users.</p>
        
        <h2 class="bio-section-head">UX Design</h2>
            <p class="bio-descriptions">One of the cool things about UX design is that it attracts people from diverse academic and working environments. I am excited to have had many different experiences that contribute to my role as a designer.<br>The skills I value the most in the science world are a huge asset to my design strategy and help me to identify a problem, research current approaches, develop a solution, test it, and then improve upon it until it solves the problem. Rock climbing has taught me to welcome challenges with a curious mindset and has gotten me very interested in the interplay between nature and technology. Building has shown me that everything humans have created is born of design decisions and it’s important to plan, prioritize and test in order to create a great product. My background in both teaching and psychology has taught me to empathize, ask questions, and understand. <br>I believe that the combination of experiences I’ve had give me a unique insight into design, and learning about UX has encouraged me to look at the world through a new lense. I have a meticulous and innovative mindset, lots of experience developing and implementing large projects from the ground up and I am excited to apply my scientific approach/mindset, empathetic curiosity and analytical problem-solving skills/determination to design problems. </p>
