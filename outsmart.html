Unfortunately <b>accidents do happen</b>, and when they do, medical professionals may not be able to reach a patient in the wilderness quickly. We live in a time where knowledge is at our fingertips, and medical information is no exception.  There are a few apps that provide basic medical advice, a few that are only accessible to people with a certificate, and many that are complex and geared towards medical professionals. Unfortunately <b>there isn’t a medical app for explorers</b>. Yet. </p>

            <p class="descriptions">In order to learn more about the potential user base for this app, I deployed a survey to one Facebook group called Girls Who Climb.  I received 188 responces in under 24 hours along with multiple requests to share the survey with other groups and tons of support and encouragement to turn this app into a reality. It is important to note that the results of this survey are skewed towards college educated, young adult female climbers however, I feel these results are representative of my target audience. The amount of interest generated in such a sort amount of time gives me confidence that this app could gain a large user base very quickly. </p>

This group is composed of people who go on long trips (54.4%) and who frequently do not have cell service for more than 24 hours (57.1%). Fortunately, this group has their phone always or most of the time (87.4%) and generally has a first aid kit (87.4%). Because users typically have a phone and generally travel with a first aid kit, we can assume that they care about safety and will be able to use the app (as opposed to a population who do not have their phone and don’t prepare for an emergency). </p>

                    <p class="descriptions"> I was as thourough as possible and review apps that were directed towards the layperson as well as medical professionals. I reviewed 9 different apps. There are apps that do a great job of covering some basic medical information and even one that offers good tips on wilderness survival. I also reviewed some top medical apps that have millions of downloads and are used by doctors world wide. This information is highly reliable, continually updated and very detailed. After conducting the SWOT analysis, I am even more confident that there is an unmet need for an app that has more information than the basic apps already on the market but is more accessible/digestible for non-medical professionals.  Below are three rerpresentative samples of the types of apps on the market.</p>

                <p class="descriptions">The American Red Cross is a highly reputable medical authority who’s app provides general information on 22 alphabetized categories. The app covers a wide range of common medical and natural emergencies in a well organized manor with a basic structure and visual brand. The app lacks a search function and has fairly limited information. Their content is based on the Everyday First Aid program developed by the British Red Cross. <br> <br> <b>Similar Apps:</b> White Cross Rescue Association, St. John Ambulance</p>

                <p class="descriptions">MD Calc has content that’s written by physician experts and used by more than 50% of US physicians every month. While their main focus is on clinical calculators, they also provide a wealth of detailed information.  Because of this, it provides way more information than would be necessary in an outdoor setting.

It provides a lot of great information but would be more useful as a learning resource and not a tool to be used during an emergency.

Because of this, a lof of time was spent on the user flows which were created to map out the steps a user would take to complete a task successfully. These helped define the scope of what needed to be included in the first testable version of the application.</p>

            <p class="descriptions">The sitemap was originally designed with a hierarchical structure that required users to navigate to the home screen whenever they wanted to switch to another section. It quickly became apparent that a <b>webbed structure worked better because it allowed easy access to necesasry imformation more quickly</b>. For example, instead of navigating from the emergency screen to the home screen and then to notes to view a note, the user can click on the notes icon at the bottom of the emergency screen.  Now,  bookmarks, emergency and notes are very connected with easy links between them while education stands on it own.</p>

Since the app is greared towards outdoorsy folk, all the colors were toned down to give them a more natural feel. The only color that wasn’t toned down is the primary red color that will be used on all emergency screens as a way to distingish the emergency screen from the rest of the app.</p>

       <p class="descriptions">User tests began early with the first test looking at one of the more important tasks; navigating from the home screen to information about a condition. Users were asked to complete the same task twice (finding information about Asthma) by navigating through two different flows.<br><br>

           <b>Buttons on the home page (left):</b> The first screen contains a search bar and 4 buttons, one of which is "emergency". Most users clicked “emergency” and were directed to the scrol conditions screen where they could select or search for Asthma and land on the emergency information screen. The users who clicked on the search bar were asked if they were experiencing an emergency via a pop-up window. If they said yes, they were directed to the scroll conditions screen and continued in the same maner as the users who clicked “emergency.”<br><br>

           <b>Scroll condition on the home screen (right):</b> The first screen in this task consists of a search bar and a scroll list of contitions. Most users selected Asthma and were presented with two buttons then were asked if they wanted to see emergency information or whether they wanted to learn more. Users who clicked the search bar navigated to Asthma and then saw the same buttons as just described. Clicking emergency directed users to the emergency information screen.</p>

       <p class="descriptions">The success rate was 100% for both tests and there was no clear preference between the two according to the users. In order to make the final decision, I asked myself what the most imporant thing to communicate here is - the answer is whether you are experiencing an emergency or not. If a user is in an emergency situation, the first thing they should do is inform the app of that. There should never be a stuation where the user is left wondering at which point that should be communicated. Because of this, I opted for the flow starting with buttons on the home screen.</p>

                <p class="descriptions">Once the basic content and navigation were sorted out,  I was able to create hi-fi mockups with color, images and typography. This is where it started getting very exciting because I got to see the ideas really coming togeter. After enough screens were generated, I created an invision prototype so I could begin user testing. I conducted in-person and remote usability tests, I made revisions based on feedback, and then I did it all again and again.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    All tests consisted of some combination of the following tasks:<br><br>

<b>Task 1</b>: Learn about the app and create an account. <br><br>

<b>Task 2</b>: Add an existing contact, add a local resource, and create a new contact. <br><br>

<b>Task 3</b>: Quickly find information about a snake bite. <br><br>

<b>Task 4</b>: Create a new note and add a text and a photo entry to it. <br><br>

<b>Task 5</b>: Call emergency responders.<br><br>
            
All tasks were completed to a very high level of success, indicating that my flows worked well and I could focus on optimizing the user experience. Below are a few highlighted changes.

        <b>Solution: </b>Contacts and resources are now sorted into two lists: the contacts that will appear on the emergency screen, and the contacts that are just accessible from the bookmark screen. This allows users to easily change their emergency contacts based on the location of the trip and the fellow travelers.</p>

            <p class="descriptions no-space">The beauty of this app is that it’s obvious. There is a clear need for an app that provides wilderness medical information to the layperson and medical professionals alike. All of the features excited users because of their usefulness and intuitive nature. For example, users should be able to combine text and photo entries in the same note. They should also be able to save local resources, personal emergency contacts, and memberships in one place.</p>
            
        <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What didn't work?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions no-space">Despite only exploring the necessary components for an MVP, the app was so loaded with features that users tended to miss some of them. The onboarding process solved this problem.</p> 
            
         <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What were your doubts going into this project?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions no-space">I was worried that I was taking on way too much. The more I thought about the app, the more features I came up with and wanted to incoorporate. I was able to focus however on the MVP and create an initial product that performs well on usability testing and has the potential to expand.</p>  
            
        <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What would you have done differently if given more time?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions no-space">I have a huge list of features that could be added to this app. For example, I didn’t explore any of the education section.</p>   
            
        <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What did you learn while doing this project?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions no-space">Each project teaches me about my stregths and weaknesses as a designer. Coming from a scientific background, my stregths lie in the research and testing side. Before studying UX, I had not done any design work but I am proud of the color, typography, branding, mood and imagery I developed for this project. I also learned more about empty states on screens where no infromation has been added, about the appropriate times to ask for permissions, and about how best to communicate with the user about actions to take to accomplish a task.</p>
