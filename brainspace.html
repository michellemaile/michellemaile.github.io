            <p class="descriptions">I began my research by posting a survey to multiple media platforms and sending it out to email contacts. My aim was to understand what users were looking for in a cloud storage application, how they utilized these types of applications, and what their main frustrations were. The data from the <a class="link" href="Survey LINK" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">preliminary survey</a>, suggest that most people are satisfied with their cloud storage service of choice with the leaders being Google, Dropbox and iCloud. However, there are some dissatisfied customers and some areas that happy customers would like to see improved. The stand out pain area for users was the organizational strategy, so a <a class="link" href="Survey LINK" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">follow up survey</a> was conducted to narrow in on a few core organizational features users could benefit from. </p>

            <p class="descriptions">Based on these findings, I decided to prioritize organizational strategies and customization. It was interesting to see a breakdown of which features users take advantage of with their current cloud storage service. Only half of users use it to create content while only about a third of users use it to collaborate. There is an opportunity here for a cloud storage service that makes these two features really stand out from the competition. However, since those features are not currently being used as much as storage and sharing, I focused on storage and sharing for the MVP.  It is vital to ensure minimum expectations are met before attempting to change consumer habits.</p>

                    1) <b>Layout:</b> First, there are some obvious trending dashboard layouts. All three sites examined featured a side panel with top bar. <br><br>
                    2) <b>List view:</b> All three also had a listview which is consistent with what I found during the user research in that users prefer a listview to an icon view. Interestingly, Google Drive incorporates both views by adding icons/previews of 4 “quick access files” above the list view. <br><br>
                    3) <b>Search bar:</b> All three had a prominent search bar. <br><br>
                    4) <b>Logo: </b>All three had their logo in the top left corner, taking up minimal space.<br><br>
                    5) <b>File organization: </b> All three provide a small preset amount of information about each file such as owner, last modified, last opened, or size. The most organizational influence the user has over this is to reverse the order on the owner or the name of the file.</p>

            <p class="descriptions">I was able to design a product that was mostly intuitive, albeit a little messy, right from the start as evidenced by user tests. This allowed me to focus my attention on the design and simplifying my product further into something that was even more easy to use. The biggest lesson learned here was to start simple and expand from there.</p>
            
        <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What didn't work?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions">My biggest hurdle was the visual design of the website. This project underwent quite a few revisions. Keeping in line with what I mentioned above, I am realizing the importance of keeping things simple and clean. For future projects, I will spend more time looking at the competition and gathering inspiration so I have a clearer design direction.</p> 
            
         <h4 class="conclusion-sections">Final thoughts.</h4>
            <p class="descriptions">I am proud of the solutions I came up with in order to tackle the problem of virtual disorganization however, the design could be improved upon. This project showed me how fun and valuable testing is at every stage of the process. I am excited to take these lessons and apply them to my next project!</p>
