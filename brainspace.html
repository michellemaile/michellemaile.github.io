            <h3 class="section-sub-titles">The Problem</h3>
                <p class="descriptions">Humans are being inundated by a massive amount of information that they want to organize and store for future use. Even though cloud storage is not a new concept and multiple big name players have already accessed the market, users are frustrated by the lack of organizational freedom and want to be able to locate their files in a way that feels more intuitive. </p>
            <h3 class="section-sub-titles">The Solution</h3>
                <p class="descriptions">Through comprehensive market analysis, user research, and user testing, I created BrainSpace. BrainSpace aims to solve the problem of digital disorganization by offering multiple layers of organization, customizable sort options, and lists that elevate this cloud storage service to an organizer, prioritizer, and collaboration tool that can handle anything.</p>
            <h3 class="section-sub-titles">My Role</h3>
                <p class="descriptions">Since this was an individual project, I was involved in every stage of the process including branding, conducting user research and competitive analysis, creating user personas, user stories, and user flows based on my research, and constructing wireframes, mockups and prototypes that went through user testing and multiple revisions. I used multiple tools including Figma, Invision and Maze.</p>

                <p class="descriptions">I began my research by posting a survey to multiple media platforms and sending it out to email contacts. My aim was to understand what users were looking for in a cloud storage application, how they utilized these types of applications, and what their main frustrations were. According to the first survey, the stand out pain area for users was the organizational strategy, so a follow up survey was conducted to narrow in on a few core organizational features users could benefit from. </p>

                    <p class="quotes">“It’s frustrating trying to find what you’re looking for” <br> “Difficult to file, tag, and sort files” <br> “It feels unorganized”</p>
            <h3 class="sub-section-titles">Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p class="descriptions">The data suggest that most people are satisfied with their cloud storage service of choice, however, there are some dissatisfied customers and some areas that happy customers would like to see improved. These frustrations are consistent across cloud storage platforms and are mostly due to a lack of organizational ability and freedom. Based on these findings, I decided to make organizational strategies and customization a top priority.</p>

                    <p class="descriptions">I conducted a competitive analysis of three cloud/online storage platforms: two, Google Drive and Dropbox, are leaders in the field, while SugarSync is less-known.<br>Google is a well-known leader in the cloud storage space and excels in the simplicity of use. The dashboard however, can be difficult to manage with its limited file sorting options, minimal collaboration features, and satellite apps that don’t consistently integrate.<br>Dropbox is another well-known leader that prides itself on collaboration and access from any device. Similar to Google however, the dashboard leaves much to be desired in terms of organizing and finding files.<br> SugarSync holds its strength in file storage that is organized in the same way as your desktop. Unfortunately, it is expensive compared to other apps and it suffers with the editing, collaboration, and creation features.</p>

Users were able to complete all three basic tasks without trouble indicating that I was off to a good start. Nonetheless, I gained some very valuable insight into how features should be changed and how I should conduct these tests in the future. <br> There were three main takeaways: <br>1) Word choice is very important. The button should read “upload” instead of “done.” <br> 2) There should be confirmation that a file was uploaded. <br>3) Having more clarifying information would be useful. For example, the window should say which file you are trying to upload or move.</p>

The decision to present the files in a list format and the decision include “star” and “share” as the two action items available in a hover state, were based on user surveys and testing. In order to address the organization complaints of cloud storage users, I decided to incorporate <b>two sorting buttons that allow users to view files based on different qualifiers.</b> A user can decide for example, that they want to view all files that were created by a specific person that have a certain tag associated with them. Once this selection has been made, the files will reorder according to these specifications. </p>

This allowed me to focus my attention on the design and simplifying my product further into something that was even more easy to use. The biggest lesson learned here was to start simple and expand from there.</p>
            
        <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What didn't work?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions">My biggest hurdle was the visual design of the website. This project underwent quite a few revisions. Keeping in line with what I mentioned above, I am realizing the importance of keeping things simple and clean. For future projects, I will spend more time looking at the competition and gathering inspiration so I have a clearer design direction.</p> 
            
         <h4 class="conclusion-sections">Final thoughts.</h4>
            <p class="descriptions">I am proud of the solutions I came up with in order to tackle the problem of virtual disorganization however, the design could be improved upon. This project showed me how fun and valuable testing is at every stage of the process. I am excited to take these lessons and apply them to my next project!</p>
