Even though cloud storage is not a new concept and multiple big name players have already accessed the market, <b>users are frustrated by the lack of organizational freedom and want to be able to locate their files in a way that feels more intuitive. </b></p>

                    <p class="descriptions">Through comprehensive market analysis, user research, and user testing, I created BrainSpace. BrainSpace aims to solve the problem of digital disorganization by offering <b>multiple layers of organization, customizable sort options, </b> and <b>lists</b> that elevate this cloud storage service to an organizer, prioritizer, and collaboration tool that can handle anything.</p>

                <p class="descriptions">I began my research by posting a survey to multiple media platforms and sending it out to email contacts. My aim was to understand what users were looking for in a cloud storage application, how they utilized these types of applications, and what their main frustrations were. According to the first survey, the stand out pain area for users was the organizational strategy, so a follow up survey was conducted to narrow in on a few core organizational features users could benefit from. </p>

                    <p class="descriptions">In addition to the insights gained from the competitive analysis outlined above, there were some interesting things to be learned by examining the dashboards of the three sites. <br><br>
                    1) <b>Layout:</b> First, there are some obvious trending dashboard layouts. All three sites examined featured a side panel with top bar. <br><br>
                    2) <b>List view:</b> All three also had a listview which is consistent with what I found during the user research in that users prefer a listview to an icon view. Interestingly, Google Drive incorporates both views by adding icons/previews of 4 “quick access files” above the list view. <br><br>
                    3) <b>Search bar:</b> All three had a prominent search bar. <br><br>
                    4) <b>Logo: </b>All three had their logo in the top left corner, taking up minimal space.<br><br>
                    5) <b>File organization: </b> All three provide a small preset amount of information about each file such as owner, last modified, last opened, or size. The most organizational influence the user has over this is to reverse the order on the owner or the name of the file.</p>

Once this selection has been made, the files will reorder according to these specifications. </p>

            <p class="descriptions">I was able to design a product that was mostly intuitive, albeit a little messy, right from the start as evidenced by user tests. This allowed me to focus my attention on the design and simplifying my product further into something that was even more easy to use. The biggest lesson learned here was to start simple and expand from there.</p>
            
        <h4 class="conclusion-sections">What didn't work?</h4>
            <p class="descriptions">My biggest hurdle was the visual design of the website. This project underwent quite a few revisions. Keeping in line with what I mentioned above, I am realizing the importance of keeping things simple and clean. For future projects, I will spend more time looking at the competition and gathering inspiration so I have a clearer design direction.</p> 
            
         <h4 class="conclusion-sections">Final thoughts.</h4>
            <p class="descriptions">I am proud of the solutions I came up with in order to tackle the problem of virtual disorganization however, the design could be improved upon. This project showed me how fun and valuable testing is at every stage of the process. I am excited to take these lessons and apply them to my next project!</p>
